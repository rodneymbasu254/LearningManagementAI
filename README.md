# Objective
The model aims to curb exam malpractice from students by helping them with; 
study plans, recommending study materials, determining their readiness score, 
asking students questions and comparing with answers, helping in research etc. 
# Abstract
The rise of exam malpractice, poor study habits, and lack of personalized learning support
are challenges that hinder academic performance. 
This project proposes a Machine Learning (ML) model that acts as an AI-powered study 
assistant, helping students track their learning progress, research effectively, and 
prepare for exams through interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based conversations. 
The model will support both English and Kiswahili, adapt to students' weaknesses and 
strengths, and assess their exam readiness while offering personalized study 
recommendations. The system will also analyze past exam papers to guide students on key 
topics. The project will be implemented as an Android and iOS mobile application with 
notifications to keep students motivated and engaged.

# Failures in the current system
1. Lecture problem(a student not understanding what the lecture entails, objective, etc)
2. Research problem(Some students find it hard to do their own research)
3. No student assesments(please do not confuse with CATs and assignments)
4. No Student engaments
5. Jokers(most are jokers)

# Problem statement
Many students struggle with self-directed learning, leading to poor performance 
and increased exam malpractice. Current study tools lack real-time interactivity, 
personalized feedback, and language flexibility. Additionally, students are often 
required to conduct independent research on topics, but many lack the proper guidance 
on how to approach research efficiently. The absence of a structured, AI-driven 
learning assistant that adapts to individual student needs has created a gap in 
effective study methods.

# Objectives  
1. Develop an AI-powered study assistant that helps students track their study progress and exam readiness.
2. Implement NLP capabilities to allow students to interact with the model in both English and Kiswahili.
3. Enable research assistance by analyzing provided course materials, objectives, and past research topics.
4. Analyze past exam papers to identify exam patterns and provide guidance on key topics.
5. Create a mobile application (Android & iOS) that delivers personalized study recommendations, notifications, and interactive Q&A.
6. Enhance exam preparedness by continuously evaluating the student's strengths and weaknesses, generating an adaptive exam readiness score.
7. Promote accountability and reduce exam malpractice by guiding students towards better study habits.

# Significance of the Project  
This project bridges the gap between traditional self-study methods and modern 
AI-powered learning. Unlike generic e-learning platforms, this system actively 
engages students, tracks their learning progress, and offers adaptive guidance. 
By incorporating NLP for multilingual support, it makes learning more inclusive. 
The project aligns with efforts to promote academic integrity, accountability, 
and better study habits.

# Technologies to be Used  
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch for AI model training.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Google’s BERT, OpenAI’s GPT, or Hugging Face models.
- Mobile Development: Flutter (Dart) or React Native.
- Backend & Database: Firebase (for cloud storage and real-time syncing).
- Exam Paper Analysis: OCR & NLP-based pattern recognition.
- Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging for reminders and motivation
